Important:
	This guide and repository only contains information and scripts to install the server-side emulation to fully unlock the superban plugin, and does not support nor supply the official web and AMXX files that may be needed to complete the plugin evironment.

Requirements:
	Dedicated gameserver and webserver with administration access. (Both can be used on the same machine and seperated machines.)

Installation:
	Put the webserver folder contents within the root of your webserver.

	Re-route the superban domain to your own webserver

		Edit your hosts file with a text edit.
			Linux:
				/etc/hosts
			Windows:
				\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

			Put this line into your hosts file. (Change the IP if needed for your configuration.)
				127.0.0.1 license.superban.net

File Notes:
	keygen.php can generate acceptable keys used by the official compiled plugin.

	superban.json is fetched by the plugin running on the game server to validate its license.
					this file will need to be recognized by the web server as a php file,
						manual configuration may be needed for this.
